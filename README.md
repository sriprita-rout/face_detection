# face_detection
Face Detection &amp; Recognition using OpenCV &amp; Deep Learning  This project demonstrates a face detection and recognition system using OpenCV, Haarcascade classifier, and a simple deep learning pipeline. It allows you to collect face images, train a recognition model, and then recognize faces in real-time using a webcam or IP camera.
